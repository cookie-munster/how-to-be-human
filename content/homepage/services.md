Jory enjoys speaking with others about his way of seeing the world. As a young child, Jory struggled with his speech. Once he did start to speak, he knew what he was trying to communicate, but his words rarely made sense to anyone else. Jory's debut book vividly describes what it is like to live in a world designed for neurotypical brains when his is decidedly not. Instead of dwelling on his limitations, Jory invites those who inhabit the neurotypical world to better understand their own.
